glZombies
=========

glZombies is a simple 2D top-down zombie survival game written in C++ using OpenGL 4.4. All game content is visualized using OpenGL primitives except for text. While OpenGL is mainly a 3D graphics API (specification), it is only used to visualize a 2D world in this case.

The main objective of this project is to experiment with the basics of OpenGL 4.4 and to understand simple artificial intelligence algorithms.
